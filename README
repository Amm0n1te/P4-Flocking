TITLE: P4: Fishtank

DESCRIPTION
This program creates a simple simulation of a fishtank from a top-down view, where the user can drop in food pellets, and the fish 
will swim towards them to eat them.  The fish will also avoid the mouse cursor.  All events are console logged.

ADDITIONAL OBJECTS: food pellet, hand, and fish tank

ARTIST'S STATEMENT
My objective was to simulate a small body of water with fish in it, including the ability to drop in food and also predators that would chase the fish around.  I did not have time to implement the predator, but I was able to make the fish afraid of the mouse cursor.  As with P3, the most difficult part of this assignment was in trying to understand how the starter code worked.  The base starter code was quite complex, and Daniel Shiffman's way of using vectors to represent boid velocity and position (instead of just a scalar and a point) was extremely confusing to me.  This resulting project was what I was able to create in 2 days.
